# John Lemon's Haunted House

Using the famous asset from the Unity store, I created this project by applying some modifications. The game has two levels, in which the second level is harder than the first one. When John gets close to a ghost, there is a `beep` sound to alarm him. The floor design is completely different from the initial package, and the ghost's behavior and menus were also customized.

## Game Files

The folder `Build` contains an `.exe` file named `Hamila_Game` to open the application. Enjoy!
